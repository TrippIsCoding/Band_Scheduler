# Church Band Scheduler

A simple Python script to schedule a church band for a 12-week period, ensuring each week has 1 drummer, 1 bassist, 1 guitarist, and 2 vocalists, while accounting for musicians' availability and multiple roles.

## Features
- Generates a band with random musician names, roles, and weeks off
- Schedules musicians based on availability and role requirements
- Handles musicians with multiple roles
- Includes basic unit tests for reliability

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `faker` library (`pip install faker`)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the scripts
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install faker
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python band_scheduler.py
   ```
4. View the generated 12-week schedule in the console
